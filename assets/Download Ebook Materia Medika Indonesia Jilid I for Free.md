The Indonesian people have developed various systems of traditional medicine, such as jamu, usada Bali, and obat asli Papua. These systems use different methods of preparation and administration of plant-based remedies, such as decoctions, infusions, powders, pills, oils, and ointments. Some of the plants used in these systems are also known and used in other countries, such as ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon.

## What is Dibac for SketchUp?
 
Dibac for SketchUp is a plugin that was developed exclusively for architectural drawings. It lets you create walls, doors, windows, stairs, wardrobes, and roofs in 2D and automatically converts them to 3D. You can also edit the 3D model by changing the parameters of the 2D elements. Dibac for SketchUp works with SketchUp 2017 to 2022 and has a trial version that runs for 16 hours of use. You can purchase a license for 69â¬ from their website[^1^].
  
## How does Dibac for SketchUp work?
 
Dibac for SketchUp adds a new toolbar and a new menu to your SketchUp interface. You can access the plugin's tools from either of them. The toolbar has icons for drawing walls, doors, windows, stairs, wardrobes, roofs, and components. The menu has options for settings, layers, styles, scenes, and help.
 
To use Dibac for SketchUp, you need to start by drawing a floor plan in 2D using the plugin's tools. You can draw walls with different thicknesses and heights, add doors and windows with various styles and dimensions, insert stairs with custom shapes and sizes, place wardrobes with different configurations and materials, and create roofs with different slopes and angles. You can also use components from the SketchUp library or your own collection.
 
Once you have finished your 2D drawing, you can click on the "3D" button on the toolbar or select "3D" from the menu. This will generate a 3D model of your floor plan in a matter of seconds. You can then orbit, pan, zoom, and inspect your 3D model as you would normally do in SketchUp.
 
If you want to make any changes to your 3D model, you can either edit the 2D elements or use the native SketchUp tools. For example, you can move, rotate, scale, copy, or delete any wall, door, window, stair, wardrobe, roof, or component in 2D and see the changes reflected in 3D. You can also use the push/pull tool to extrude or cut faces, the move tool to adjust edges or vertices, the paint bucket tool to apply materials or colors, and so on.

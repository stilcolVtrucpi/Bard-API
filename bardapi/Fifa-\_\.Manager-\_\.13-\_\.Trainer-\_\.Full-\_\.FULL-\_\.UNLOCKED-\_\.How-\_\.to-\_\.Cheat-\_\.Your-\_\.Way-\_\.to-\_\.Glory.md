- Use players that fit their roles and have good attributes for their positions. For example, use fast and skillful wingers, strong and aerially dominant strikers, creative and visionary playmakers, etc.
- Use the right mentality for each match situation. For example, use attacking or very attacking when you need to score goals, use defensive or very defensive when you need to protect a lead, use balanced or counter when you need to control the game.
- Use the right team instructions for each match situation. For example, use short or mixed passing when you want to keep possession, use direct or long passing when you want to create chances quickly, use high or low tempo when you want to dictate the pace of the game.
- Use the right player instructions for each match situation. For example, use run with ball or dribble more when you want to exploit space, use shoot more often or try long shots when you want to test the goalkeeper, use mark tighter or tackle harder when you want to press the opponent.
